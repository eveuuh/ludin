# The Ludin Concept ♟

Ludin was created in order to meet the boardgame community closest to you!
Tired of not being able to test or play your games because Peter or Paul is still missing?
Post an add, and meet your future game partners!

# How it works ❓ 🎲

❓- You just bought Zombicide but your friends don't like it?
✅ Post an event to find other fans of this game to play with you!

❓- You don't have boardgames and you would like to discover them with experienced players?
✅ Search by name if you have a particular idea, or by city in the Gamenight tab!
